# FAQ

### You spelt visualization wrong.

As the main author of this project is Australian â€” a country which speaks a 
variation of British English, words such as `visualisation` are spelt with an `s`
instead of a `z`. Another word you may find incorrectly spelt is `colour`. Please
don't issue Pull Requests to fix this.
